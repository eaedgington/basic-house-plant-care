                    <td headers="water">These are succulents which are mainly made up of water and retain a lot of water in it's foliage (for storage), similar to a cactus. The soil needs to be moist which is easy to check by placing a finger an inch deep into the soil to make sure it is not dry. It needs much less in the winter. .</td>
                    <td headers="sun">The A.Vera thrives on bright light conditions, but not direct sunlight. Heat is fine because they react similar to a cacti in hot conditions. Bright rather than light (direct), is the key.</td>

                    <td headers="water">This plant does drink a lot of water in the summer. Keeping the soil moist (not over watered) and allowing it to dry slightly near the top is a good idea. If in the winter the soil stays slightly damp for a couple of weeks or more, that's ok , dont water any more. Your plant will let you know when it needs more.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">As mentioned above they like light, however, direct sunshine can damage plant leaves. A mixture of light and shade is great, if you can provide it. If you see the leaves yellowing this could be caused by too much sunlight.</td>

                    <td headers="water">	Because this plant is a succulent it stores water within its foliage, so it is not necessary to keep the soil damp. Water from spring to fall when the soil becomes dry to the touch and during the winter only once a month. Be careful not to over water as this can cause the root and base of the plant to rot.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">The mother in laws tongue is well known for coping with direct sun and low light conditions, although bright light conditions with some sun light and shade is preferred.</td>

                    <td headers="water">During the growing season from April - September water the plant thoroughly and then water when the soil becomes dry to the touch (not bone dry though). Winter is a tricky time for these plants although they are a tough species. Many growers will overwater then alongside cold temperatures or drafts the plant can become very sick, or even die. The leaves are storage organs so during the winter water much less and allow the top soil to dry out</td>
                    <td headers="sun">Display this plant anywhere it can receive plenty of sun or bright light. South facing windows will provide the most sun, however, east or west provide direct sun part of the day that I find more suitable.</td>

                    <td headers="water">Only water once the soil has become dry and then soak the soil, but do not leave water in the bottom tray. During the winter you'll need to water less. Because this is a succulent - it stores water within its leaves, so even if you forget to water for a period of time the plant will be fine.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">This kalanchoe - like many other succulents loves basking in bright light and sunshine. A mixture of direct, indirect and shade is a good balance of sunlight - if that can be provided.</td>

                    <td headers="plantname"><b>Jelly Beans</b> - Sedum Pachphyllum</td>
                    <td headers="water">During the spring and summer months the plant will require more water but it is important to allow it to dry out in between watering. It should be planted in soil that drains well and it should not be allowed to sit in water.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">Some direct light is preferable for this plant. South facing windows are ideal or west, north facing will not encourage growth.</td>

                    <td headers="water">Even though the Sedum rubrotinctum has the ability to cope with dry conditions it will require extra water during the spring and summer months. However, it is important to give the plant time to dry out before watering it again.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">Some direct light is preferable for this plant. South facing windows are ideal or west, north facing will not encourage growth. It can handle cooler climates and hotter climates and because it can handle drought conditions it can be placed in areas that are exposed to long periods of sunlight.</td>

                    <td headers="plantname"><b>Century Plant</b> - Agave Americana</td>
                    <td headers="water">Like other succulents, the Agava americana does need more water during its growth period. Water enough to make the potting mixture moist but allow two thirds of the potting mixture to dry out before watering again. During the rest period the plant requires very little water and only enough to stop the potting mixture from drying out. In it's natural sub-tropical and semi-arid regions it spends a lot of time without water and survives well because the leaves are storage organs for water and nutrients.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">While it can be kept in partial shade it does require full sunlight. This means that it will grow well on a sunny windowsill or outside soot that is south or east facing. During the winter months it is crucial that the plant receives as much light as possible.</td>

                    <td headers="water">The Polka-dot Cactus is a desert species. It should be given water on a regular basis during its first season in a new pot. This will help it to create a strong root system. The soil should be kept moist, but not soggy. After the first season, more sporadic watering is required. During the winter cycle, the cactus should not be watered at all, with watering to resume in the early spring.</td>
                    <td headers="sun">Demands full light growing for most of the year, except during the winter cycle. For the plant's health, light should be reduced to partial sun during this time.</td>

                    <td headers="water">It's best to allow the soil to become dry between each watering which will depend on the time of year, how much humidity and amount of sunlight it's getting. Allowing too much water to sit at the bottom of the pot with the roots will cause them to rot (avoid this).</td>
                    <td headers="sun">The jade plant flourishes in good health with plenty of light. If you can provide a few hours of sunshine a day your going to have a happy plant.</td>
